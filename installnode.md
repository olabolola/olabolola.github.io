1. Install a node version manager. We will use `nvm`. This is for OSx and Linux only.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

2. Run 
```bash
nvm install node
```

to get the latest node release.

You can specify a node version by

```bash
nvm install 12
```

and select which node version you want to use with

```bash
nvm use 12
```
